# lint-staged
Use Case: Useful for when you want to use other code quality tools along with Prettier (e.g. ESLint, Stylelint, etc.) or if you need support for partially staged files (git add --patch).

Make sure Prettier is installed and is in your devDependencies before you proceed.

```
npx mrm lint-staged 
```
